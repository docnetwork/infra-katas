# infra-katas
Short, focused exercises that helps you learn to manage infrastructure through code at Docnetwork (or elsewhere)

## Purpose

This repo started as a personal quarterly goal.  At DocNetwork we have a training program we call merit badges.  The infrastructure merit badges I originally wrote relied on external training resources a fair amount.  We ran into a snag however when a number of them were removed from the internet (I am looking at you kubernetes).  I also found that our junior developers were looking for additional ways to practice with infra related topics and tools.  

My solution to the problem is to take inspiration from programming katas and create infrastructure related katas that one could use to learn infrastructure-as-code tools and techniques. A kata, or code kata, is defined as an exercise in programming which helps hone your skills through practice and repetition. My goal is to create a collection of infrastructure related katas that a junior developer, devops engineer, or other interested person can use to learn and practice with.
 
### Using these katas for practice

A good practice session is one where you have time to focus on a single task, without distractions. You should be comfortable making mistakes, and you should be able to get feedback on your progress. It is important to keep the practice fun, and to make small steps forward each time. You will know that you had a good practice session if you feel like you have learned something new

Remember, the kata is not about finding the right answer. It is about the journey, not the destination. The goal is to learn and improve your skills, not to win.


# TODO
- Collect the rest of the initial katas
- Rewrite this document and remove specifics of my goal and just include what the repo is for.
