# infra-katas
Short, focused exercises that helps you learn to manage infrastructure through code at Docnetwork (or elsewhere)

## Purpose

This repo started as a personal quarterly goal.  At DocNetwork we have a training program we call merit badges.  The infrastructure merit badges I originally wrote relied on external training resources a fair amount.  We ran into a snag however when a number of them were removed from the internet (I am looking at you kubernetes).  I also found that our junior developers were looking for additional ways to practice with infra related topics and tools.  

My solution to the problem is to take inspiration from programming katas and create infrastructure related katas that one could use to learn infrastructure-as-code tools and techniques. A kata, or code kata, is defined as an exercise in programming which helps hone your skills through practice and repetition. My goal is to create a collection of infrastructure related katas that a junior developer, devops engineer, or other interested person can use to learn and practice with.
 
### My quarterly goal:
- S :  Create a public, open source, repo of infrastruture katas forcused on the needs of DocNetwork engineers. :heavy_check_mark: 
- M : A template for creating katas is the repo and a layout that supports having katas for terraform, k8s, and aws. :heavy_check_mark: 
    - At least three examples of a kata for each of the three initial areas is created.
        - TF1: tf-intro :heavy_check_mark: 
        - TF2:
        - TF3:
        - AWS1:
        - AWS2:
        - AWS3:
        - K8S1:
        - K8S2:
        - K8S3:
- A :  I can pull excersises from the internet to create katas.  I can also solicit ideas from the GLTL group.
- R : Katas are a useful way for learners to practice the their skills. They can also be used to practice skills we don't use that often. Katas are used for programming but I think we could also use them for infrastructure topics including terraform, k8s, and aws.  
- T: This will support the next level of learning for our developers and give us a structure to update our infra merit badges were free resources have been removed from the internet.


### Using these katas for practice

A good practice session is one where you have time to focus on a single task, without distractions. You should be comfortable making mistakes, and you should be able to get feedback on your progress. It is important to keep the practice fun, and to make small steps forward each time. You will know that you had a good practice session if you feel like you have learned something new

Remember, the kata is not about finding the right answer. It is about the journey, not the destination. The goal is to learn and improve your skills, not to win.


# TODO
- Collect the rest of the initial katas
- Rewrite this document and remove specifics of my goal and just include what the repo is for.
